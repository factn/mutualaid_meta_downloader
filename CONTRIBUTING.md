## Submitting a PR

If you don't want to wait for us to give you write access you are more than welcome to use the forking workflow for your first PR and just [fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and then create a PR that way.
In fact we'd encourage it for the first PR.

## What does success look like?

Just to reiterate from the main project. This is what success looks like..

- Be helpful, on the ground, for real world organisers
- Be easy for new developers to commit code quickly
- Be easy to use
- Be robust and scalable

**No matter your role, your help is very much appreciated!**
